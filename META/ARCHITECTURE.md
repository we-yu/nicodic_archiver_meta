# Architecture

This document is the canonical architecture description
for the nicodic_archiver project.

This file is the source-of-truth architecture document.

Copies of this file may be synchronized to:

- `copilot/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `cursor/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

Those copies exist for repository-local readability,
but this root file is the canonical version.

--------------------------------------------------

Project purpose

The project archives comment threads from the NicoNicoPedia BBS.

Goal:

- preserve comments locally
- keep access even if original comments are deleted
- store static information only

Stored data includes:

- response number
- poster name
- poster ID hash
- posted timestamp
- comment text
- comment HTML

Excluded data includes:

- GOOD / BAD counts
- other dynamic metrics

--------------------------------------------------

Current architecture

main.py

    bounded target identity parsing

    structured run-block emission
    bounded daily rollover
    bounded weekly log compaction

web_app.py
    bounded Web-facing archive-check and follow-up actions
    bounded target registration
    bounded saved-article download format selection
    saved article download formats:
    - txt
    - md
    - csv
    default saved-download format:
    - txt

cli.py
    archive-facing CLI output formatting

tests/
    focused unit-test layer protecting current bounded responsibilities

--------------------------------------------------

Status after TASK003

- main.py is thinner than before
- orchestration has been extracted to orchestrator.py
- minimal unit tests now exist for main.py and orchestrator.py
- tests/conftest.py supports pytest import resolution
- production behaviour is intended to remain unchanged

--------------------------------------------------

Design principles

- keep CLI compatibility
- prefer small, explainable refactors
- preserve behavior unless a task explicitly changes it
- prefer stability over novelty
- keep module responsibilities clear
- compare AI implementations before adoption

--------------------------------------------------

Refactoring guidance

Good refactors:

- reduce responsibility overlap
- make main.py thinner without changing CLI behavior
- add focused tests around existing behavior
- improve workflow tooling when review friction is observed

Avoid by default:

- redesigning multiple layers at once
- expanding task scope silently
- introducing configuration systems without clear need
- changing behavior during structure-only tasks

--------------------------------------------------

Workflow context

This project uses a Double Helix Development Model.

For one task:

- Copilot implementation is produced in `copilot/`
- Cursor implementation is produced in `cursor/`
- both are reviewed
- one is adopted, or a hybrid is adopted
- both repos are then realigned to the same final state

For practical workflow steps, refer to:

- `WORKSPACE.md`
- `META/TASK_CYCLE_CHECKLIST.md`

For adoption history, refer to:

- `META/review_log/`

--------------------------------------------------

Future note

Unless a later task explicitly changes architecture,
this document should be treated as the post-TASK038 baseline.

Important current interpretation:

- the bounded Web/runtime publication baseline exists
- the runtime Web surface is publicly reachable through bounded nginx front-door
  publication at:
  - `nicoarc-prelim.mimizuku.dev`
- the current Web saved-download baseline now includes bounded format selection
  for:
  - `txt`
  - `md`
  - `csv`
- default saved-download format remains `txt`
- HTML export remains deferred
- JSON export remains deferred
- append-only scrape-run telemetry still exists in bounded form
- telemetry CSV export remains a read-only derived artifact
- broader observability, GUI admin expansion, PostgreSQL migration,
  DB containerization, and wider dashboard/platform work remain deferred
  unless a later task explicitly brings them into scope
